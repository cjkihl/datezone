title: Why NOT to use Date
description: Understanding the fundamental problems with JavaScript's Date object and why you should avoid it
---



JavaScript's `Date` object is one of the most problematic APIs in the language. While it seems convenient at first, it's the source of countless bugs and unpredictable behavior in applications. Here's why you should avoid it at any cost.

## The Core Problems

### 1. No Timezone Support

The `Date` object doesn't support explicit timezones. It only knows about the local system timezone and UTC, making it really difficult to work with dates in a predictable way.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 1", file: "guides/why-not-to-use-date/example-1.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="info">
**Machine-dependent behavior**: The same code produces different results depending on where it's executed. This makes your application unpredictable and hard to test.

- The JavaScript `Date` object reflects the host system's **local time-zone**.

- There is no API in JavaScript to override this.
</Callout>

### 2. Confusing constructor

The `Date` object's constructor string parser have strange behavours. These might lead to errors that are really hard to track down.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 2", file: "guides/why-not-to-use-date/example-2.ts" }]} />

### 3. Confusing API Method Names

The `Date` object has poorly named methods that don't match what you'd expect, making code hard to read and prone to errors.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Confusing API", file: "guides/why-not-to-use-date/confusing-api.ts" }]} />

You would expect `getDate()` to also use a 0-based index for the day of the month just like `getDay()`, but it doesn't.

<Callout type="warning">
**Counter-intuitive naming**: 
- `getDay()` returns day of **week** (0-6), not day of month
- `getDate()` returns day of **month** (1-31), not the full date
- Day of week uses 0=Sunday instead of ISO 8601 standard where Monday=1
</Callout>

### 4. Mutable State = Bugs

`Date` objects are mutable, which might lead to unexpected side effects and hard-to-track bugs.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 3", file: "guides/why-not-to-use-date/example-3.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="danger">
**Mutation bugs**: Methods like `setHours()`, `setDate()`, etc. modify the original object instead of returning a new one. 
- Violates the principle of immutability and can cause subtle bugs.
- **Confusing return values**: `setDate()` returns a timestamp, making it appear like an immutable function when it also mutates the original object.
</Callout>

### 5. Unpredictable Results

The same code returns different results depending on the system timezone, making unit testing unreliable.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 4", file: "guides/why-not-to-use-date/example-4.ts" }]} />

### 5. Not Serializable

`Date` objects don't serialize well. When you send them over HTTP or store them in JSON, you lose the Date() object.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 5", file: "guides/why-not-to-use-date/example-5.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="info">
**Serialization problems**: Libraries like `superjson` exist to work around this, but they add complexity and overhead to your application.
</Callout>

### 6. Only Supports Gregorian Calendar

The `Date` object only works with the Gregorian calendar. While this calendar is widely used, many cultures use different calendar systems (like Islamic, Hebrew, Thai Buddhist, or Chinese calendars).

<Callout type="error">
**Limited calendar support**: JavaScript Date() only supports the Gregorian calendar.
</Callout>

## The Alternative: Timestamps

JavaScript has a much better built-in native type for handling dates: `number` (timestamps)!

### Why Timestamps Are Better

- **Immutable**: It's just numbers
- **Serializable**: Work perfectly with JSON
- **Predictable**: Always represent the same moment in time no matter environment, timezone or calendar system 
- **Efficient**: No extra object allocation or garbage collection overhead
- **Testable**: Easy to create predictable tests that works everywhere.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 6", file: "guides/why-not-to-use-date/example-6.ts" }]} />

## Summary

The JavaScript `Date` object is tricky and are a big cause of Date & Time related bugs in global applications.
