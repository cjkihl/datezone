Always set timestamp explicit.

Relying on the browser timestone is not a great user experience. It's better for the user to be able to select timezone with default set to browser timezone.

This is how Outlook works for example. 


Dont to artimetic even for simple date math.

If you have a timestamp it might be tempting to just add 86400 seconds to the timestamp if you want to add one day.

However this might lead to really hard to track bugs along the way.

Becuase of DST in a lot of timezones. Some days are 25 hours and some days are 23 hours!

For dateMath always use datezone addDays, subDays.

Datezone keeps a registry of all timezones that have DST and not.

For non DST timezones. datezone use simple arithmetic as a fast path optimization.

For DST timezones, it's doing some magic to compesate for DST differenses.


Dont use the Date object. 

Date object is horrible. Read about it here. (Link)

Instead store timestamps. They dont take space on the JavaScript heap and are easy to sent over https.

If you want to display a timestmapt use datezone toIsoString (Example below.)


Don't do DST calculations more than once, 

For most functions datezone have 2 functions one that takes a timestamp as parameter and a base function that takes wall time as parameter.

If you do multiple calculations in a row or already know the walltime you can in most cases skip the DST calculation completely when calling a lot of functions after each other.
