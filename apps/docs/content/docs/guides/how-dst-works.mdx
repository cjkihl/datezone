title: How Daylight Saving Time Works
description: Understanding DST transitions and why they're the biggest source of hard-to-find date bugs in applications
---



Daylight Saving Time (DST) is one of the most common sources of subtle, hard-to-reproduce bugs in software applications. These bugs often only manifest twice a year, making them incredibly difficult to catch during development and testing.

## The main problem

<Callout type="error">
Not All Days Are 24 Hours!
</Callout>
 

The fundamental assumption that "a day is always 24 hours" is **wrong** in most timeZones that observe DST.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 1", file: "guides/how-dst-works/this-assumption-is-dangerous.ts" }]} />

During DST transitions:
- **Spring forward**: Days are 23 hours long (lose 1 hour)
- **Fall back**: Days are 25 hours long (gain 1 hour)

### The "Twice a Year" Bug

DST bugs are particularly insidious because they only happen during the two DST transition periods each year. This means:

- Your tests might pass 363 days of the year
- Your application works fine in production most of the time
- But twice a year, a critical bug, might happen: A calendar event is set to the wrong time.

<Callout type="info">
**Production nightmare**: DST bugs often appear suddenly in production, typically in the middle of the night when you are asleep.
</Callout>

## Common DST Bug Examples

### Spring Forward (Losing an Hour)

On March 10, 2024, in the `America/New_York` timeZone:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 2", file: "guides/how-dst-works/at-200-am-est-clocks-spring-forward-to-300-am-edt.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="error">
**What went wrong?***
1. Two local timestamps span the DST ‚Äúspring-forward‚Äù gap: ‚Äú2024-03-10 01:59‚Äù (EST, UTC-5) is immediately followed by ‚Äú2024-03-10 03:00‚Äù (EDT, UTC-4); the entire 2 o‚Äôclock hour never occurs.
2. A naive subtraction therefore returns 1, under-reporting the elapsed wall-clock time by an hour.
üêû Bug: 61 calendar minutes passed on the wall clock, but our application reports only 1 minute
</Callout>

### Fall Back (Gaining an Hour)

On November 3, 2024, in the `America/New_York` timeZone:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 3", file: "guides/how-dst-works/at-200-am-edt-clocks-fall-back-to-100-am-est.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="error">
**What went wrong?***
1. Two wall-clock timestamps look identical: ‚Äú2024-11-03 01:30‚Äù in New York occurs twice‚Äîonce as EDT (UTC-4) and again an hour later as EST (UTC-5).
2. A substracting them returns 60, even though, from a local-time perspective, you expected the difference between identical wall-clock moments to be 0.
üêû Bug: The calculations ignores the DST ‚Äúfall-back‚Äù hour silently introducing a ¬≠one-hour error.
</Callout>

### Different timeZones on browser and server

It get's worse when your server and users are in different timeZones.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 4", file: "guides/how-dst-works/this-breaks-during-dst-transitions.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="error">
**What went wrong?***
1. New York moved clocks forward at 2 AM on 2024-03-10, making the day only 23 hours long.
2. addDays adds exactly 24 hours, so the wall-clock time shifts forward by +1 hour.
3. The client expected 18:00 SGT on the next day, but would see 19:00 when the server response is converted back.

üêû Bug summary: Even with an explicit timeZone offset in the input, server-side date math that relies on
   the server's local timeZone can silently drift during DST transitions.
</Callout>

## How Datezone Handles DST

Datezone is always explicit about the timeZone when you are doing Date & Time operations. 
Every operation that is prone to DST bugs have a `timeZone` parameter that is **required**.
This might feel overkill at first but it sets you as a developer up for success and hels you avoid DST bugs.
Always ask yourself: In which **Timezone** am I doing this calendar calculation?:

<CodeExample tabs={[
  { name: "DST Handling", file: "reference/faq/daylight-saving-time.ts" }
]} />

<Callout type="info">
**Correct**
Datezone uses IANA Timezones and knows when to do the DST transitions accordingly
</Callout>


<CodeExample tabs={[
  { name: "DST Handling", file: "reference/faq/daylight-saving-time-2.ts" }
]} />


<Callout type="info">
**Correct**
Notice how we added one hour, but the clock jumps from **1:30** to **3:30**, skipping the nonexistent 2 AM hour due to DST.
</Callout>

### Safe Calendar Date Arithmetic

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Calendar Date Arithmetic", file: "guides/how-dst-works/calendar-date-arithmetic.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="info">
**Correct**
Here we simulate a spring forward transition in New York. 
- From **2024-03-10 01:30 GMT-5** to **2024-03-11 01:30 GMT-4**
- The difference in actual hours is **23 hours**
- But on the Calendar it's **1 day and 0 hours** later.
</Callout>


### Timezone-Sensitive Operations

Some operations break not only during DST transitions. but all the time.

You want start of day? 

Ok but start of day where? Is it start of day in Tokio or in New York?
This is very critical information for your application.

`Datezone` forces you to Specify a timezone if you want start of day, end of day etc.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 8", file: "guides/how-dst-works/always-returns-the-correct-startend-of-day-regardless-of-dst.ts" }]} />

## DST Best Practices

### 1. Always Specify Timezones

Having a system the behaves differently depending where your user is based or where your server is deployed is **bad**.
This leads to hard to find bugs in production that you can't reproduce locally.

By always being explicit with timezonen in your application makes your code predictable and easy to test. 

### 2. Use Calendar Arithmetic, Not Time Arithmetic

Before doing any date & time editing. Think twice: Do I want to move forward x amount of milliseconds or do I want to jump to the next day?.
In most cases you want to use Calendar Arithmetic when building user facing applications. Humans think in calendar dates, not timestamps.

### 3. Store in timestamps

Calendar Arithmetic is good for interacting with the user but it's prone to timezone errors. 
Always store your date and time in Timestamps that are universial.

## DST Around the World

DST rules vary significantly by country and region:

- **Northern Hemisphere**: Spring forward in March/April, fall back in October/November
- **Southern Hemisphere**: Opposite schedule (spring forward in September/October)
- **No DST**: Many countries/regions don't observe DST at all
- **Different Rules**: Some countries have unique DST schedules

<Callout type="info">
**IANA Timezone Database**: Datezone uses the IANA timeZone database, which contains the complete history and future predictions of DST rules for all timeZones worldwide.
</Callout>

## Summary

DST transitions are a major source of bugs in date-handling code. By understanding how DST works and using timeZone-aware functions like those provided by datezone, you can avoid these pitfalls entirely.

<Callout type="success">
**Key takeaway**: Never assume a day is 24 hours. Always use calendar-based arithmetic with explicit timeZone handling for reliable date operations.
