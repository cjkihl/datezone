title: How Daylight Saving Time Works
description: Understanding DST transitions and why they're the biggest source of hard-to-find date bugs in applications
---



Daylight Saving Time (DST) is one of the most common sources of subtle, hard-to-reproduce bugs in software applications. These bugs often only manifest twice a year, making them incredibly difficult to catch during development and testing.

## The DST Problem

### Not All Days Are 24 Hours

The fundamental assumption that "a day is always 24 hours" is **wrong** in most timezones that observe DST.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 1", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-1.ts" }]} />

During DST transitions:
- **Spring forward**: Days are 23 hours long (lose 1 hour)
- **Fall back**: Days are 25 hours long (gain 1 hour)

### The "Twice a Year" Bug

DST bugs are particularly insidious because they only happen during the two DST transition periods each year. This means:

- Your tests might pass 363 days of the year
- Your application works fine in production most of the time
- But twice a year, everything breaks

<Callout type="warning">
**Production nightmare**: DST bugs often appear suddenly in production, typically at 2 AM on a Sunday, when most development teams are asleep.
</Callout>

## DST Transition Examples

### Spring Forward (Losing an Hour)

On March 10, 2024, in the `America/New_York` timezone:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 2", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-2.ts" }]} />

### Fall Back (Gaining an Hour)

On November 3, 2024, in the `America/New_York` timezone:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 3", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-3.ts" }]} />

## Common DST Bugs

### 1. Naive Date Arithmetic

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 4", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-4.ts" }]} />

### 2. Recurring Events

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 5", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-5.ts" }]} />

### 3. Duration Calculations

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 6", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-6.ts" }]} />

## How Datezone Handles DST

Datezone automatically handles DST transitions by using IANA timezone data and intelligent date arithmetic.

<CodeExample tabs={[
  { name: "DST Handling", file: "reference/faq/daylight-saving-time.ts" }
]} />

### Safe Date Arithmetic

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 7", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-7.ts" }]} />

### Timezone-Aware Operations

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 8", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-8.ts" }]} />

## DST Best Practices

### 1. Always Specify Timezones

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 9", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-9.ts" }]} />

### 2. Use Calendar Arithmetic, Not Time Arithmetic

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 10", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-10.ts" }]} />

### 3. Be Careful with Recurring Events

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 11", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-11.ts" }]} />

### 4. Test DST Transitions

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 12", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-12.ts" }]} />

## DST Around the World

DST rules vary significantly by country and region:

- **Northern Hemisphere**: Spring forward in March/April, fall back in October/November
- **Southern Hemisphere**: Opposite schedule (spring forward in September/October)
- **No DST**: Many countries/regions don't observe DST at all
- **Different Rules**: Some countries have unique DST schedules

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 13", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-13.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="info">
**IANA Timezone Database**: Datezone uses the IANA timezone database, which contains the complete history and future predictions of DST rules for all timezones worldwide.
</Callout>

## Debugging DST Issues

### 1. Log with Timezone Information

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 14", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-14.ts" }]} />

### 2. Test Edge Cases

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 15", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-15.ts" }]} />

### 3. Use UTC for Calculations, Local for Display

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 16", file: "guides/how-dst-works/example-16.ts" }]} />

## Summary

DST transitions are a major source of bugs in date-handling code. By understanding how DST works and using timezone-aware functions like those provided by datezone, you can avoid these pitfalls entirely.

**Key takeaway**: Never assume a day is 24 hours. Always use calendar-based arithmetic with explicit timezone handling for reliable date operations.
