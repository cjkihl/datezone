title: Why Use Timestamps
description: Learn why timestamps are the superior choice for handling dates and times in JavaScript applications
---



After understanding [why JavaScript Date is problematic](/docs/guides/why-date-is-evil), you might wonder what the alternative is. The answer is simple: **timestamps**. JavaScript's `number` type is actually the perfect data type for representing dates and times.

## What Are Timestamps?

A timestamp is a number representing milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). It's a single number that unambiguously represents a specific moment in time, anywhere in the world.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 1", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/const-timestamp-datenow-eg-1704067200000.type" }]} />

## Why Timestamps Are Superior

### 1. Universal and Unambiguous

Unlike `Date` objects, timestamps represent the exact same moment in time regardless of where your code runs.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 2", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/this-timestamp-represents-the-same-moment-everywhere.type" }]} />

### 2. Immutable by Nature

Numbers cannot be mutated in JavaScript, eliminating an entire class of bugs.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 3", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/original-is-unchanged.type" }]} />

### 3. Perfect Serialization

Timestamps serialize and deserialize perfectly with JSON, databases, and APIs.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 4", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/all-values-are-still-numbers-ready-to-use.type" }]} />

### 4. Zero Memory Overhead

Timestamps are primitive values with no object overhead on the JavaScript heap.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 5", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/efficient-memory-usage.type" }]} />

### 5. Mathematical Operations

You can perform arithmetic directly on timestamps without special functions.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 6", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/const-start-datenow.type" }]} />

## Working with Timestamps in Datezone

Datezone is designed from the ground up to work with timestamps, providing all the functionality you need while maintaining the benefits of timestamps.

### Basic Operations

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 7", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/import-adddays-subdays-from-datezone.type" }]} />

### Timezone-Aware Operations

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 8", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/add-a-day-in-new-york-timeZone-handles-dst-automatically.type" }]} />

### Comparison and Validation

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 9", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/clear-readable-comparisons.type" }]} />

## Converting from Date Objects

When you need to work with existing Date objects, convert them to timestamps immediately:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 10", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/convert-existing-date-to-timestamp.type" }]} />

## Best Practices with Timestamps

### 1. Store Timestamps in Your Database

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 11", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/placeholder-example-for-storing-timestamps-in-a-database.type" }]} />

### 2. Use Timestamps in APIs

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 12", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/api-responses.type" }]} />

### 3. Convert to Display Format Only When Needed

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 13", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/store-as-timestamp.type" }]} />

## Common Timestamp Patterns

### Creating Timestamps

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 14", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/current-time.type" }]} />

### Time Calculations

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 15", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/const-minute-60-1000.type" }]} />

### Range Checking

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 16", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/const-isinrange-timestamp-number-start-number-end-number.type" }]} />

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Replace Date.now() Calls

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 17", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/creating-date-objects.type" }]} />

### Step 2: Convert Function Parameters

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 18", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/functions-taking-date-objects.type" }]} />

### Step 3: Update Data Storage

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 19", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/storing-date-objects-often-serialized-as-strings.type" }]} />

## Summary

Timestamps are the ideal way to handle dates and times in JavaScript applications. They're simple, efficient, predictable, and work seamlessly with the web platform. Combined with datezone's timeZone-aware functions, you get all the power you need without any of the pitfalls of Date objects.
