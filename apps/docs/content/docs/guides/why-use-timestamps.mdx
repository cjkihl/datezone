title: Why Use Timestamps
description: Learn why timestamps are the superior choice for handling dates and times in JavaScript applications
---



After understanding [why JavaScript Date is problematic](/docs/guides/why-date-is-evil), you might wonder what the alternative is. The answer is simple: **timestamps**. JavaScript's `number` type is actually the perfect data type for representing dates and times.

## What Are Timestamps?

A timestamp is a number representing milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). It's a single number that unambiguously represents a specific moment in time, anywhere in the world.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 1", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-1.ts" }]} />

## Why Timestamps Are Superior

### 1. Universal and Unambiguous

Unlike `Date` objects, timestamps represent the exact same moment in time regardless of where your code runs.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 2", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-2.ts" }]} />

### 2. Immutable by Nature

Numbers cannot be mutated in JavaScript, eliminating an entire class of bugs.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 3", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-3.ts" }]} />

### 3. Perfect Serialization

Timestamps serialize and deserialize perfectly with JSON, databases, and APIs.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 4", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-4.ts" }]} />

### 4. Zero Memory Overhead

Timestamps are primitive values with no object overhead on the JavaScript heap.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 5", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-5.ts" }]} />

### 5. Mathematical Operations

You can perform arithmetic directly on timestamps without special functions.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 6", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-6.ts" }]} />

## Working with Timestamps in Datezone

Datezone is designed from the ground up to work with timestamps, providing all the functionality you need while maintaining the benefits of timestamps.

### Basic Operations

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 7", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-7.ts" }]} />

### Timezone-Aware Operations

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 8", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-8.ts" }]} />

### Comparison and Validation

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 9", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-9.ts" }]} />

## Converting from Date Objects

When you need to work with existing Date objects, convert them to timestamps immediately:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 10", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-10.ts" }]} />

## Best Practices with Timestamps

### 1. Store Timestamps in Your Database

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 11", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-11.ts" }]} />

### 2. Use Timestamps in APIs

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 12", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-12.ts" }]} />

### 3. Convert to Display Format Only When Needed

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 13", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-13.ts" }]} />

## Common Timestamp Patterns

### Creating Timestamps

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 14", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-14.ts" }]} />

### Time Calculations

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 15", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-15.ts" }]} />

### Range Checking

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 16", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-16.ts" }]} />

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Replace Date.now() Calls

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 17", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-17.ts" }]} />

### Step 2: Convert Function Parameters

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 18", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-18.ts" }]} />

### Step 3: Update Data Storage

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 19", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-19.ts" }]} />

## Summary

Timestamps are the ideal way to handle dates and times in JavaScript applications. They're simple, efficient, predictable, and work seamlessly with the web platform. Combined with datezone's timezone-aware functions, you get all the power you need without any of the pitfalls of Date objects.
