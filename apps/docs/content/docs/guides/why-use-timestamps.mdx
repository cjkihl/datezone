title: Why Use Timestamps
description: Learn why timestamps are the superior choice for handling dates and times in JavaScript applications

After understanding [why JavaScript Date is problematic](/docs/guides/why-not-to-use-date), you might wonder: are there any alternative? 

The answer is: **timestamps**. JavaScript's `number` type is the perfect data type for representing a moment in time.

## What Are Timestamps?

A timestamp is a number representing milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). It's a single number that unambiguously represents a specific moment in time, anywhere in the world.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 1", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/timestamp-example.ts" }]} />

## Why Timestamps Are Superior

### 1. Universal and Unambiguous

Unlike `Date` objects, timestamps represent the exact same moment in time regardless of where your code runs.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 2", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/this-timestamp-represents-the-same-moment-everywhere.ts" }]} />

### 2. Immutable by Nature

Numbers cannot be mutated in JavaScript, eliminating an entire class of bugs.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 3", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/original-is-unchanged.ts" }]} />

### 3. Perfect Serialization

Timestamps serialize and deserialize perfectly with JSON, databases, and APIs.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 4", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/all-values-are-still-numbers-ready-to-use.ts" }]} />

### 4. Zero Memory Overhead

Timestamps are fast and lightweight primitive values with no object overhead on the JavaScript heap.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 5", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/efficient-memory-usage.ts" }]} />

### 5. Mathematical Operations

You can perform arithmetic directly on timestamps without special functions.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 6", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/timestamp-math.ts" }]} />

## What Timestamps Are Lacking

Even though timestamps are the best *storage* format, they are not the best *presentation* or *manipulation* format for humans.

### 1. Human-Readable Calendar Values

Humans think in calendar units: "March&nbsp;14 at 3 PM", not `1710436800000`. Whenever you need to **display** a date or accept input from a human, convert the raw timestamp with datezone's formatting helpers.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Example 1", file: "guides/why-use-timestamps/example-1.ts" }]} />

### 2. No Built-in DST Awareness

Simple timestamp math works for seconds, minutes and hours, but beyond that you will run into issues with Daylight Saving Time (DST). Adding *24 × 60 × 60 × 1000* milliseconds will **usually** move you one day forward, but not across a DST transitions.

<CodeExample name="Breaks during DST" file="guides/how-dst-works/at-200-am-est-clocks-spring-forward-to-300-am-edt.ts" />

### 3. Higher-Level Calendar Operations

Operations such as "add one month", "start of week", or "is the date a weekend" are **calendar concepts** and subjective to where the user is located. `datezone` offers a *time-zone-aware* API on top of timestamps to cover all of these cases without sacrificing the benefits you gained from using numbers.

<Callout type="info">
Datezone is designed as a *thin layer* above timestamps: use raw numbers for and performance, then use datezone whenever you have to think 'Calendar' like a human.
</Callout>

## Summary

Timestamps are the ideal way to handle dates and times in JavaScript applications. They're simple, efficient, predictable, and work seamlessly across environments.

<Callout type="info">
**Key benefits**: Timestamps eliminate time-zone ambiguity, serialization issues, mutation bugs, and testing problems while providing better performance and simpler code.
