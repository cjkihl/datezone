description: How to install Datezone in your project.
---

## Install with Bun, npm, or yarn

```package-install
datezone
```

## Requirements
- Node.js 18+, Deno or Bun
- Works in modern browsers and serverless environments

## Usage Example

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Basic Usage", file: "basic/installation-example.ts" }]} />

## ESM Compatibility & Module Resolution

Datezone is a **modern ESM module** that may require configuration changes in older projects. If you encounter import errors, this section will help you resolve them.

- **Pure ESM module** with `"type": "module"` in package.json
- **Uses the `exports` field** instead of legacy `main`/`types` fields  
- **No legacy fallback** - relies entirely on the modern `exports` field

### Common Installation Issues

If you see errors like these, your project needs modern module resolution:

```
Cannot find module 'datezone' or its corresponding type declarations
Module not found: Can't resolve 'datezone'
```

### Fix: Update Module Resolution

Update your `tsconfig.json` to use modern module resolution:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "bundler", // or "node16"/"nodenext"
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ES2022"
  }
}
```

### Module Resolution Comparison

| Resolution | Support | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| `"node"` (Legacy) | ❌ **Won't work** | Only understands `main` field, not `exports` |
| `"bundler"` (Modern) | ✅ **Recommended** | Full `exports` field support, works with all bundlers |
| `"node16"`/`"nodenext"` | ✅ **Works** | Node.js native ESM support |

### For Older Projects

If you're working with a legacy codebase that cannot be upgraded:

1. **Update TypeScript** to version 4.7+ for `"bundler"` support
2. **Use a modern bundler** (Vite, Webpack 5+, or Bun)
3. **Consider polyfill alternatives** if stuck with very old tooling

### Framework-Specific Notes

- **Next.js**: Requires version 13.1+ for proper ESM support
- **Vite**: Works out of the box with default configuration
- **Webpack**: Requires version 5+ with ESM support enabled
- **Create React App**: May need ejecting or switching to Vite
