This page contains frequently asked questions, common issues, and other helpful information about the datezone library.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between Date objects and timestamps?">
  
JavaScript Date objects and timestamps serve different purposes:

**Date Objects** are JavaScript's built-in date representation that includes timezone information based on the user's system:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Date Objects vs Timestamps", file: "reference/faq/date-objects-vs-timestamps.ts" }]} />

**Timestamps** are numbers representing milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Working with Timestamps", file: "reference/faq/date-objects-vs-timestamps.ts" }]} />

With datezone, you can easily work with both formats and convert between them seamlessly.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How should I handle timezones for REST APIs?">

For REST APIs, always use UTC timestamps or ISO 8601 strings to avoid timezone confusion:

**Recommended approach - UTC timestamps:**

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "UTC Timestamps for APIs", file: "reference/faq/api-utc-timestamps.ts" }]} />

**Alternative - ISO 8601 strings:**

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "ISO 8601 Strings for APIs", file: "reference/faq/api-iso-strings.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="warn">
  Never send timezone-specific dates without explicit timezone information in APIs.
  This leads to confusion when users are in different timezones.
</Callout>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are timezones so complicated in JavaScript?">

JavaScript's built-in Date object has several limitations:

1. **No timezone information**: Date objects don't store which timezone they represent
2. **System timezone only**: All dates are interpreted in the user's system timezone
3. **Limited formatting**: Basic formatting options without locale support
4. **Mutation issues**: Date objects are mutable, leading to bugs

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "JavaScript Date Problems & Solutions", file: "reference/faq/javascript-date-problems.ts" }]} />

Datezone solves these issues by providing:
- Explicit timezone handling
- Immutable operations
- Rich formatting options
- Better parsing capabilities

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I convert between timezones?">

Use the formatting functions with explicit timezone parameters to convert dates between timezones:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Timezone Conversion", file: "reference/faq/timezone-conversion.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="info">
  The underlying timestamp remains the same - only the display changes based on timezone.
</Callout>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What timezone formats does datezone support?">

Datezone supports multiple timezone formats for maximum flexibility:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Timezone Formats", file: "reference/faq/timezone-formats.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="warn">
  IANA timezone names are preferred because they handle daylight saving time automatically.
  UTC offsets are static and don't account for DST changes.
</Callout>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle daylight saving time?">

When using IANA timezone names, datezone automatically handles daylight saving time (DST):

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Daylight Saving Time", file: "reference/faq/daylight-saving-time.ts" }]} />

<Callout type="info">
  DST transitions are handled automatically - you don't need to worry about the complexities.
</Callout>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I format dates for different locales?">

Use the formatting system with locale-specific patterns:

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Date Formatting", file: "reference/faq/date-formatting.ts" }]} />

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Common TypeScript issues">

If you're facing TypeScript errors with datezone:

**Make sure strict mode is enabled:**
```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

**Import and usage examples:**

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "TypeScript Configuration", file: "reference/faq/typescript-config.ts" }]} />
