## addDays

Adds a number of days to a timestamp or options object.

```ts
addDays(ts: DayOptions | number, days: number, timeZone: TimeZone | null): number
```

<CodeExample tabs={[
  { name: "With timezone", file: "reference/day/add-days-timezone.ts" },
  { name: "Local time", file: "reference/day/add-days-local.ts" }
]} />

<Callout type="info">
**Why do we need to specify a timezone when adding days?**

Isn't 1 day always 24 hours (86,400 seconds)?

**Not always!** Due to Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions, some days are 23 or 25 hours long.

**Example:** In the `America/New_York` timezone on March 11, 2023 at 1:00 PM EST:
- Simply adding 24 hours would result in March 12, 2023 at 2:00 PM EDT
- But the correct "1 day later" should be March 12, 2023 at 1:00 PM EDT
- This is because March 12, 2023 was only 23 hours long due to the spring DST transition

**Summary:** The length of a day varies depending on the timezone and DST transitions, which is why timezone-aware day arithmetic is essential for accurate date calculations.
