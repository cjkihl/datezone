## `intervalToDuration`

Calculates a human-readable duration between two UTC timestamps, expressed
as calendar components (years, months, days … milliseconds) in the
specified time-zone.

Internally the function converts both instants to `Calendar` structures in
the target zone and then delegates the heavy-lifting to
.

The **sign** of the interval does not matter – if `start` is after `end`
the arguments are swapped so the returned duration is always positive.

## `intervalToDurationBase`

Low-level counterpart to . Both arguments MUST be
in the **same time-zone context** – normally produced with
`timestampToCalendar`.

It performs a calendar subtraction using a classic borrow-chain so that the
result components are always non-negative.

## `areIntervalsOverlapping`

Checks whether two half-open intervals overlap.

Mathematically the function answers whether
`[start1, end1) ∩ [start2, end2) ≠ ∅`.
Border-touching intervals (e.g. `end1 == start2`) are **not** considered an
overlap.

## `clamp`

Restricts a numeric `value` to the [min, max] range.
Equivalent to `Math.min(Math.max(value, min), max)` but without the extra
function calls.
