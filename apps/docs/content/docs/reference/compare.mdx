# Compare Utilities

Compare utilities provide functions for comparing dates and timestamps, including relative time comparisons and date equality checks.

## Daily Comparisons

Check if dates are today, tomorrow, or yesterday.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Function Signatures", file: "reference/compare/function-signatures.ts" }]} />

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Daily Comparisons", file: "reference/compare/basic-comparisons.ts" }]} />

## Time-based Comparisons

Check if dates are in the past or future.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Time-based Signatures", file: "reference/compare/time-based-signatures.ts" }]} />

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Past/Future Comparisons", file: "reference/compare/time-comparisons.ts" }]} />

## isWeekend

Check if a date is a weekend.

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Weekend Examples", file: "reference/compare/weekend-examples.ts" }]} />

_Note: The remaining comparison functions (isBefore, isAfter, isEqual, isSameDay, isSameWeek, isSameMonth, isSameYear) would follow the same pattern with their own CodeExample components._
