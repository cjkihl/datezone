Datezone is a lightweight, high-performance date and timezone utility library for JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a simple, modern API for parsing, formatting, comparing, and working with dates and times. Every function includes full support for IANA timezones and DST.

## üéØ Why Datezone

**Because Date & Time in JavaScript is really hard!**

JavaScript's native `Date` object has no timezone support. Existing libraries need extra plugins like `@date-fns/tz` or `date-fns-tz` that add complexity with wrapper objects like `TZDate`.

Datezone is built from the ground up with timezones and DST support built into every function. No plugins or special wrapper objects needed.

### üèóÔ∏è **Modern Architecture**
- **Built on the modern Intl API** and math calculations instead of relying on the Date object
- **Performance first** - uses timestamps to be memory efficient
- **Made to run 1000 times a second** without performance loss
- **Easier to send over HTTP** with timestamp-based operations

### üöÄ **Blazing Fast Performance**
- **18,000%+ faster** in timezone operations
- **45,000%+ faster** for simple date math  
- **No performance loss** as your app scales

See [Comparison](/docs/comparison) and [Benchmarks](/benchmarks/comparison-report)

### üì¶ **Developer Experience**
- **ESM only** tree-shaking - only import what you use
- **100% TypeScript** with strict types that catch errors at compile time
- **Zero dependencies** - no extra packages to worry about
- **33.76KB** total size, competitive with major alternatives

### üåç **Native Timezone Excellence**
- **Timezones built into every function** - no plugins required
- **Native IANA timezone support** with automatic DST handling

<Callout type="info">
**Why do we need to specify a timezone when adding days?**

Isn't 1 day always 24 hours (86,400 seconds)?

**Not always!** Due to Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions, some days are 23 or 25 hours long.

**Example:** In the `America/New_York` timezone on March 11, 2023 at 1:00 PM EST:
- Simply adding 24 hours would result in March 12, 2023 at 2:00 PM EDT
- But the correct "1 day later" should be March 12, 2023 at 1:00 PM EDT
- This is because March 12, 2023 was only 23 hours long due to the spring DST transition

**Summary:** The length of a day changes depending on the timezone and DST transitions. That's why timezone-aware day calculations are essential for accurate date math.
