Datezone is a lightweight, high-performance date and timezone utility library for JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a modern, ergonomic API for parsing, formatting, comparing, and manipulating dates and times, with full support for IANA timezones and DST.

## Why Datezone?

Working with dates and timezones in JavaScript has long been a source of frustration. Datezone aims to solve this by providing:

- **Accurate timezone handling** (IANA, UTC, local)
- **Fast, tree-shakeable functions** for all common date operations
- **Strict TypeScript types** for safety and autocompletion
- **Tiny bundle size** and zero dependencies
- **Comprehensive formatting and parsing**
- **Performance-focused**: faster than legacy libraries like Moment.js

## Features

- Parse, format, and compare dates and times
- Convert between timezones (IANA, UTC, local)
- Handle daylight saving time (DST) correctly
- Add, subtract, and manipulate dates
- Get week, month, year, and other calendar info
- Fully typed API

...and much more!
