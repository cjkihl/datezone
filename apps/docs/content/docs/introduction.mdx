Datezone is a lightweight, high-performance date and timeZone utility library for JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a modern, ergonomic API for parsing, formatting, comparing, and manipulating dates and times, with full support for IANA timeZones and DST.

## üéØ Why Datezone

**Because Date & Time in Javascript is really hard!**

JavaScript's native `Date` object has no timeZone support, and existing libraries require additional plugins like `@date-fns/tz` or `date-fns-tz` that add complexity with wrapper objects like `TZDate`.

Datezone is built from the ground up with timeZones and DST support natively integrated into every function, eliminating the need for plugins or special wrapper objects.

### üèóÔ∏è **Modern Architecture**
- **Built around the modern Intl API** and arithmetic calculations instead of relying on the Date object
- **Performance first** - works in timestamps to be friendly for the garbage collector
- **Made to run 10,000 times a second** without performance degradation
- **Easier to serialize and send over HTTP** with timestamp-based operations

### üöÄ **Blazing Fast Performance**
- **18,000%+ faster** in timeZone operations
- **45,000%+ faster** for date arithmetic  
- **No performance regression** as your app scales

See [Comparison](/docs/comparison) and [Benchmarks](/benchmarks/comparison-report)

### üì¶ **Developer Experience**
- **ESM only** tree-shaking - only import what you use
- **100% TypeScript** with strict types that catch errors at compile time
- **Zero dependencies** - no supply chain bloat
- **33.76KB** total size, competitive with major alternatives

### üåç **Native Timezone Excellence**
- **Timezones built into every function** - no plugins required
- **Native IANA timeZone support** with automatic DST handling

<Callout type="info">
**Why do we need to specify a timeZone when adding days?**

Isn't 1 day always 24 hours (86,400 seconds)?

**Not always!** Due to Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions, some days are 23 or 25 hours long.

**Example:** In the `America/New_York` timeZone on March 11, 2023 at 1:00 PM EST:
- Simply adding 24 hours would result in March 12, 2023 at 2:00 PM EDT
- But the correct "1 day later" should be March 12, 2023 at 1:00 PM EDT
- This is because March 12, 2023 was only 23 hours long due to the spring DST transition

**Summary:** The length of a day varies depending on the timeZone and DST transitions, which is why timeZone-aware day arithmetic is essential for accurate date calculations.
