Datezone is a lightweight, high-performance date and timezone utility library for JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a modern, ergonomic API for parsing, formatting, comparing, and manipulating dates and times, with full support for IANA timezones and DST.

## 🎯 Why Datezone

JavaScript's native `Date` object has no timezone support, and existing libraries require additional plugins like `@date-fns/tz` or `date-fns-tz` that add complexity with wrapper objects like `TZDate`.

Datezone is built from the ground up with timezones natively integrated into every function, eliminating the need for plugins or special wrapper objects.

### 🏗️ **Modern Architecture**
- **Built around the modern Intl API** and arithmetic calculations instead of relying on the Date object
- **Performance first** - works in timestamps to be friendly for the garbage collector
- **Made to run 10,000 times a second** without performance degradation
- **Easier to serialize and send over HTTP** with timestamp-based operations

### 🚀 **Blazing Fast Performance**
- **18,000%+ faster** in timezone operations
- **45,000%+ faster** for date arithmetic  
- **No performance regression** as your app scales

See [Comparison](/docs/comparison) and [Benchmarks](/benchmarks/comparison-report)

### 📦 **Developer Experience**
- **ESM only** with perfect tree-shaking - only import what you use
- **100% TypeScript** with strict types that catch errors at compile time
- **Zero dependencies** - no supply chain bloat
- **33.76KB** total size, competitive with major alternatives

### 🌍 **Native Timezone Excellence**
- **Timezones natively built into every function** - no plugins required
- **Native IANA timezone support** with automatic DST handling
