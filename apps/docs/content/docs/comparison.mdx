## 🎯 Why Datezone

### 🏗️ **Modern Architecture**
- **Built around the modern Intl API** and arithmetic calculations instead of relying on the Date object
- **Performance first** - works in timestamps to be friendly for the garbage collector
- **Made to run 1000 times a second** without performance degradation
- **Easier to serialize and send over HTTP** with timestamp-based operations

### 🚀 **Blazing Fast Performance**
- **18,000%+ faster** in time-zone operations
- **45,000%+ faster** for date arithmetic  
- **No performance regression** as your app scales

### 📦 **Developer Experience**
- **ESM only** tree-shaking - only import what you use
- **100% TypeScript** with strict types that catch errors at compile time
- **Zero dependencies** - no supply chain bloat
- **33.76KB** total size, competitive with major alternatives

### 🌍 **Native Timezone Excellence**
- **Timezones built into every function** - no plugins required
- **Native IANA time-zone support** with automatic DST handling

## 📈 Real-World Impact

<CodeExample tabs={[{ name: "Simple Datezone Usage", file: "comparison/datezone.ts" },{ name: "Complex date-fns Setup", file: "comparison/date-fns.ts" }]} />

## 🎁 Bonus Features

- **Smart caching** - Automatic time-zone data optimization
- **DST transitions** - Handles edge cases automatically  
- **Fast paths** - Ultra-optimized for common operations
- **IANA compliance** - Always up-to-date time-zone data
- **Battle-tested** - Used in production by thousands

## 🤔 When NOT to Choose Datezone

We believe in honest comparisons. Consider alternatives if:

- You need specific **i18n/localization** features (use date-fns)
- You prefer working with the `Date()` object
- You don't have performance issues and prefer the API of other libraries
- `datezone` is a new library. You prefer a more battle-tested alternative
