## ⚡ Why Datezone is Fast

Our [benchmarks](/benchmarks/comparison-report) show Datezone wins **86% of the time** against date-fns:

### 🎯 **What's Faster**
- **Timezone stuff**: 10-100x faster than other libraries
- **Adding days/months**: Much quicker math
- **Formatting dates**: Faster text output
- **Parsing dates**: Quicker text-to-date conversion

### 📈 **Notable Performance Areas**
- **Day operations**: Significant improvements in timezone-aware date calculations
- **Format operations**: Faster date formatting across all timezone contexts  
- **ISO operations**: Enhanced parsing and serialization performance
- **Month/Year calculations**: Optimized calendar arithmetic

### 🔬 **Benchmark Methodology**
Our benchmarks compare equivalent timezone-aware operations using:
- **Datezone**: Built-in timezone support
- **date-fns**: v4.x with @date-fns/tz package
- **Realistic test scenarios** across different timezone contexts
- **Statistical significance** testing with multiple iterations

*Your results might be different depending on what you're building.*

## 🎯 Should You Use Datezone?

Datezone might be a good fit for your project if:

### 🏗️ **Modern Architecture Needs**
- You want built-in timezone support without additional dependencies
- You prefer working with timestamps for performance-critical applications
- You need immutable date operations by default

### 🚀 **Performance Requirements**
- You're doing frequent date calculations in performance-sensitive code
- You need consistent performance when handling many date operations
- You want to minimize garbage collection pressure

### 📦 **Modern Experience**
- Built for today's JavaScript
- Tree-shaking to keep bundles small
- No old baggage from 2010
